# pizzaproject
PizzaProject takes orders and submits customer data to a local mysql database. I used PHP to create two forms, which submitted to
two separate tables, one for taking orders, and the other for gathering customer information. The first form is written solely in
HTML; the second form is in a PHP file, which makes inputs from the first form (price) more accessible. Improvements to this project
include input validation (dont allow 0 pizzas in the first form), secure input fields (its possible to change the price of the pizza), 
and more dynamic user interface (animated pizza toppings anyone?).
